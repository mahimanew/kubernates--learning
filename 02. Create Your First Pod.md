### **Step 1: Create Your First Pod**  
A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which runs one or more containers. Let's create a simple **nginx** Pod.

1️⃣ Create a file named `nginx-pod.yaml`  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

2️⃣ Apply the YAML file to create the Pod  
```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

3️⃣ Verify the Pod is running  
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
Expected output:  
```
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-nginx   1/1     Running   0          5s
```

---

### **Step 2: Access the Pod**
Pods in Kubernetes don’t get public IPs by default, so we need to access them internally.

1️⃣ Get detailed Pod information  
```sh
kubectl describe pod my-nginx
```

2️⃣ Access the Pod via `kubectl exec`  
```sh
kubectl exec -it my-nginx -- /bin/sh
```
Inside the container, check if **nginx** is running:  
```sh
curl http://localhost
```
To exit the container shell, type:  
```sh
exit
```

---

### **Step 3: Expose the Pod as a Service**
Since our Pod is running, we need to expose it so that other services or users can access it.

1️⃣ Expose the Pod using a **ClusterIP Service**  
```sh
kubectl expose pod my-nginx --type=ClusterIP --port=80
```

2️⃣ Check the Service  
```sh
kubectl get services
```
Expected output:
```
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
my-nginx     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1     <none>        80/TCP    5s
```

### **Next Steps**
Now that you have a Pod running and exposed as a Service, next, we’ll:  
✅ Learn about **Deployments** (to scale and manage Pods)  
✅ Create a **LoadBalancer Service** to expose apps externally  
✅ Understand **ReplicaSets** and **Scaling Pods**
